## Application Functionality and Appearance

When a user loads the page, users can enter a book title, author or keyword to search the Google Book API. Users are able to save from the rendered list. When a user navigates to the saved books, they are presented with a list of books they have saved. Users are able to remove books from thier saved lists and an updated list will be presented to the user.
